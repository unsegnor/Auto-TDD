**Examples:**
_Write some examples of use. Think of what the user is not able to do now and how it should feel when the idea is finished. Be very specific and detailed and always answer the questions: What does the user want? Why? How would the user interact with the system? Who starts the interaction? What information do they share within the interaction? How the user gets what it wanted?_

**Rules:**
_Many examples define a rule. And once the rule is set other examples could be generated. Write down the rules as you extract them from the examples. ( and be sure to add the examples that better define the rule )_

**Doubts:**
_Write any situation that may be not so clear and you think that we need to work on._


**Developer Notes:**
_Write any considerations about the way it could be implemented or any technical issues we may have to deal with._

Add property based testing
Make a UI to create tests (read and write on a local file)
Deploy docker container as a lambda function (follow this: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#images-upload)
Show the version of the application in a /version endpoint
Testing with external dependencies
Testing with internal state
Testing updates
    deploying lambda function (with state)
    updating a container image? we should take care of transferring the state or reusing or whatever, always through the api of that state?
Test deploying the application to kubernetes
Use node version from nvmrc file (I think it is not needed as renovate will update the FROM version in the Dockerfile)
Ensure we use the same commands to build the container for test and manually to debug
Create a github action to share among all the repos
Should we use docker-bench-security? seems like it is evaluating my host instead of the Dockerfile: https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security
Measure coverage from component tests
Use docker containers also for dev environment
Add tests for published docker images, is it needed?
